    {

    }

    /**
     * Get the mail representation of the notification.
     */
    public function toClicksendVoice(object $notifiable) // Voice
    {
        return ClickSendVoiceMessage::create(
            message: 'Your Verification Code is: 1234 - I repeat: 1234 - Goodbye!',
            to: $notifiable->phone_number
        );
